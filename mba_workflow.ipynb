    "# Multivariate bias adjustment workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "# This notebook provides an example workflow for multivariate bias adjustment (MBA) in the context of \n",
    "# thermal stress. The workflow uses four input variables (air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, \n",
    "# and downwelling solar radiation) to calculate mean radiant temperature (Tmrt), and the Universal Thermal \n",
    "# Climate Index (UTCI).\n",
    "\n",
    "# To achieve this, we emply a diurnal version of Cannon's N-dimensional multivariate bias correction (MBCn)\n",
    "# (2018), guided by the work of Faghih (2022). Each variable undergoes individual bias adjustment in the \n",
    "# form of Quantile Delta Mapping (QDM) (Cannon et al., 2015). These adjustments are multiplicative for all\n",
    "# variables except air temperature, which is adjusted additively. To retain diurnal and annual cycles, \n",
    "# inputs are grouped by hour of the day and week of the year, with weeks 52 and 53 combined to avoid \n",
    "# week 53 containing few data points. 30 quantiles are used for each group. Mismatches in solar radiation between our historic model outputs\n",
    "# and \"observations\" (we use reanalysis data here) very occasionally led to infinite adjustment factors.\n",
    "# Accordingly, we set these adjustment factors to zero. This occurred in 0.065% of cases for the six models\n",
    "# in Weeding et al. (2023). \n",
    "\n",
    "# Once each input variable is individually adjusted, the variables are adjusted as a group using the \n",
    "# MBCn algorithm. Bias adjusted inputs are grouped by hour of the day and day of the year to retain the \n",
    "# diurnal and annual cycles as strongly as possible. 20 quantiles were used per group, and 20 iterations \n",
    "# performed. "
